# Dice-game
My very first project in Javascript |
Dice game allows the users to draw two random dice faces which will be assigned to two players and depending on the side they get, the user either wins or looses |
This game use images for dice faces, and javascript to give it a random choice functionality | 
Hope you like it ☺️
